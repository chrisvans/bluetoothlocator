bluetoothlocator setup instructions
===================================

We are using postgres, you'll need to set up a local postgres database.

Set up a username_local.py file in the config folder, username is your name.

Add this line at the top of the file,
import * from common

Reference your local DB like so (insert your own values for those surrounded by {{}} ): 

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': '{{ POSTGRES DATABASE NAME }}',
        # The following settings are not used with sqlite3:
        'USER': '{{ DATABASE OWNER USERNAME }}',
        'PASSWORD': '{{ DATABASE OWNER PASSWORD }}',
        'HOST': '',                      # Empty for localhost through domain sockets or '127.0.0.1' for localhost through TCP.
        'PORT': '',                      # Set to empty string for default.
    }
}

In your .bashrc file, include this:

export DJANGO_BLUETOOTH_SECRET='insert_random_string_of_letters_here'

Make sure to reload your terminal if it is open after editing your .bashrc file, or do this in the terminal:
source ~/.bashrc

To get setup on your local environment:

pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py syncdb

At this point, it will ask you to set a superuser.  Since this is local, set up a simple username / password that you will not forget.

python manage.py migrate

This will tell south to run the migrations currently in the migrations folder.

To run the server, use python manage.py runserver --settings=config.username_local

To run the django app in a shell, use python manage.py shell --settings=config.username_local

To create a test object under the current schema, do this in the shell:

import datetime
from nodes.models import Node
Node.objects.create(device_id = 'CCF0023', rssi_data = -78, distance = 5, timestamp = datetime.datetime.now(), node_id = 'South Corridor', confidence = 2, location_x = 21, location_y = -22, origin_x = 0, origin_y = 0)
Node.objects.all()

Note: To format a datetime object from the database (always stored as UTC) into a proper timezone-relevant Unix measurement of time in milliseconds, do this:

from nodes.models import Node
from django.utils.dateformat import format
from django.utils.timezone import get_current_timezone
node = Node.objects.all()[0]
timestamp = node.timestamp
timestamp = timestamp.replace(tzinfo=get_current_timezone())
timestamp = int(format(timestamp, "U"))*1000


Should all have gone well, you should receive no errors.

The django-admin is setup.  If you go to http://localhost:8000/admin/ you can manage database objects.
